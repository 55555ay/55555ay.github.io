Among the three kinds of wolves, Alpha is most powerful and strong. We use it to name our team in the hope that our team can also achieve such results in the competition.\n同时，我们战队的Logo是一个彭罗斯三角，这样的设计一来是因为三角形与“Alpha”一词中的字母A形状相近，二是因为它是一个不可能物体，因此象征我们的战队能够克服不可能的挑战。\n The logo of our team is a Penrose triangle. It is designed like this because the triangle is similar to the letter A in the word “Alpha”, and the other is because it is an impossible object, so it symbolizes that our team can also overcome impossible challenges.\n（合照图片）团队合照\n王省/May：\n（个人照图片）王省是广州誉德莱国际学校九年级的学生，在队伍中担任队长。本赛季是她参加的第二个VEX赛季，在上一个赛季中她参加了三场比赛。今年的战队Logo设计与绘制均由她完成。\n何晋侨/Raymond：\n（个人照图片）何晋侨是广州誉德莱国际学校八年级的学生，今年八年级。本赛季是他参加的第二个VEX赛季，在上一个赛季中他参加了两场比赛，他非常喜欢这个比赛。在本赛季的赛前训练过程中主要负责机器的搭建工作。由于上赛季有大量的队员退出并且何晋侨是负责操作的这导致在搭建时遇到了非常多的问题。幸好他是一个非常愿意投入大量时间的人。正是因为这样在搭建时这个队伍有更多的次数来试错。\n许家玮/William：\n（个人照图片）许家玮是广州誉德莱国际学校的学生，今年七年级。本赛季是他参加的第一个VEX赛季。\n2. 训前准备/Preparation before Training2.1. 赛季安排/Schedule of the Season\n六月：对新赛季的规则进行分析研究，并通过比赛得分与惩罚的规则判断机器人的功能需求。同时，在拟定了机器人的雏形后，则可以开始研究比赛中的战术和策略。\nJune: Study and analyze the rules of the new season, and confirm the functional requirements of robots based on the rules of game scoring and punishment. At the same time, after drawing up the prototype of the robot, we can begin to plan the tactics and strategies in the game.\n七月：在完成了一些前期的准备工作后，我们就可以根据机器人的功能需求开始着手搭建。在这个过程中，我们必然会遇到一些困难和需要做出改动的地方；因此留出一个月的余地有助于我们不断完善我们的机器人，以争取在正式训练之前达到最佳状态。\nJuly: After completing some preliminary preparations, we can start to construct the robot according to the functional requirements. In this process, we will inevitably encounter some difficulties and need to make changes; therefore, leaving a room for a month will help us continue to improve our robots in order to achieve the best condition before formal training.\n八月&amp;九月：八月到九月这段时间将会用于代码编写和手动&amp;自动训练。在完成了机器人的搭建后，我们需要根据机器人的结构与功能进行手动与自动代码的编写。在这个阶段，我们需要不断调整与测试代码，以及面临种种挑战。而在代码没有编写完成之前，我们无法开始正式训练，我们会尽快完成代码的编写以尽早开始训练。\nAugust &amp; September: The period from August to September will be used for code writing and driver controlled &amp; autonomous competition training. After completing the construction of the robot, we need to write manual and automatic codes according to the structure and function of the robot. At this stage, we need to constantly adjust and test the code, and face various challenges. Before the code is written, we cannot start formal training. We will complete the code as soon as possible to start training as soon as possible.\n十月：经过1-2个月的训练后，我们将开始参加比赛。在比赛的过程中我们会不断发现策略上不成熟的地方以及机器结构方面的不足，尤其是在比赛初期。因此我们不光要参加比赛，同时也要从实战中学习：认识到自己的不足并学习其他队伍的优点。\nOctober: After 1-2 months of training, we will start participating in the competition. In the course of the game, we will continue to find strategically immature places and deficiencies in the machine structure, especially in the early stages of the game. Therefore, we must not only participate in the competition, but also learn from actual combat: recognize our own shortcomings and learn from the strengths of other teams.\n十一月：到了这个阶段，我们的机器和策略应该已经经历了至少一次改动，这些我们都会详细记录在工程日志内以供赛后回顾和反思。在比赛告一段落后，我们将对自己在比赛中的表现进行评估与分析，保持优点、反思并改正缺点，并根据自己的状态在下次比赛前调整心态、巩固训练，从而取得更好的成绩。\nNovember: At this stage, our robot and strategies should have undergone at least one change, which we will record in detail in the engineering log for review and reflection after the game. After the game is over, we will evaluate and analyze our performance in the game, maintain our strengths, reflect on and correct our shortcomings, and adjust our mentality and consolidate training before the next game according to our own state, so as to achieve better results.\n2.2. 规则研究/Researching about the Rules\n2.2.1. 规则1.0/Rule 1.0\n得分方式：\n\n套环：在场上一共有72个环，其中12个是预装，18个导入物，和42个在场上。环单独是不算分的，队伍一定要将环套入环塔内并在比赛结束时让这个环塔在我方区域我方联队环塔除外，如果把环放入环塔底座并可以获得一份，如果把环放入任意支杆上即可获得3分，如果把环放入中立环塔的高支杆上即可获得10分。但是如果环在套入环塔后碰到了机器直接作废。\n环塔：在场地上有2种不一样的环塔分别时是，4个联队环塔（每个联队有两个环塔），3个中立塔其中有一个是带有高支杆。当比赛结束时如果有中立环塔或者我方联队环塔底座的任意部位在我方区域即可获得20分。\n平衡桥：当比赛结束时如果平衡桥在平衡的状态下，上面有中立环塔或者这个联队的联队环塔这个联队即可获得40分，如果平衡桥上有机器并这联队可以获得30分。否则不会有任何的加分。但是如果当平衡桥在平衡状态下有任何东西在接触平衡桥的同时接触地面或者围栏，平衡就会作废。\n\nWays to Score：\n\nRings: On the filed there are 72 rings, which is made up of 12 begin as preloads, 18 match loads, and 42 that begin on the field. Rings don’t count as point individually it must be put on to a mobile goal, and to get the point the mobile goal must be inside the alliance home zones except alliance mobile goal. If it is in the base of a mobile goal, it is 1 point, if it is on the branch of a mobile goal, it is 3 points, and if it is on the high branch of a mobile goal, it is 10 points. However, if the ring touches the robot when it is in a mobile goal then this ring will not count fir points.\nMobile Goals：On the filed there are 2 different kinds of mobile goal, which is make up of 4 alliance mobile goals 2 for each alliance and 3 neutral mobile goals one with a high branch. When the match end if there is a neutral mobile goal or our alliance mobile goal this alliance can get 20 points for each mobile goals.\nPlatforms: When the match end if the platform is balance and have neutral mobile goals or this alliance mobile goals this alliance will have 40 points for each mobile goals. And if on the platform when it is balance there are robots on it each robot can give this alliance 30 points. If the platform is not balance, then the point will not change. If when the platform is balancing and anything that touch the platform and touch the ground or the rim of the filed, then it will not be count as a balance.\n\n其它重点规则：\n\n比赛开始前，机器不可以接触任何场上的道具，预装除外。\n最后30秒直接或间接触碰对方联队的平衡桥，触碰到的队伍取消本局比赛的成绩。不会影响到联队的成绩。\n1台机器一次不能囤积超过1个环塔。违反者会被警告，如果影响到比赛，则会被取消本场比赛的资格。\n自动赛不可以超过对方联队的区域。\n\nOther important Rules:\n\nThe robot cannot touch any scoring objects other than the preloads before the match has start.\nIn the last 30 seconds, the team that directly or indirectly touched the platform of the opposing alliance will have the result of the competition cancelled. This will not affect the performance of the United team.\n1 robot can only hoard one mobile goal at once, teams that break this rule will get a warn if it has affected the match then this team will get disqualified.\nIn the autonomous robot must stay out from the opponent’s home zone.\n\n2.2.2. 规则2.0/Rule 2.0\n规则改动：\n\n第二代规则主要更改了自动赛的得分，从原本的20分改成了6分，并且在自动赛时平衡桥不算分。\n这使自动赛不再是让手动赛有一个分数上的领先，而是在环塔数量上的领先。\n\nModification of the Rules:\n\nThe main changes of the second generation of rules is the point of winning the autonomous form 20 points to 6 points. And the platform will not add any points.\n Because of this the focus of the autonomous has change from getting an advantage in the points to the numbers of mobile goals an alliance can get.\n\n3. 机器搭建/Construction of the Robot3.1. 功能需求/Functional Requirement：\n根据我们对本赛季比赛规则的研究，我们初步确定机器人需要具备以下功能：1.自由移动及转向2. 举起和放置环塔3. 抓取并投掷圆环\nAccording to our research on the competition rules of this season, we preliminarily determine that the robot needs to have the following functions:\n\nFree movement and steering\nLift and place the Mobile Goals\nGrab and throw the Rings\n\n经过团队会议后，我们认为机器人需要具备三种装置以满足功能需求：\n\n底盘\n套环装置\n抬臂装置\n\nAfter a team meeting, we believe that the robot needs to contain three devices to meet the functional requirements:\n\nChassis\nRing evice\nArm Lifting Device\n\n同时，在此基础上，机器人的大小不能超过18✖️18✖️18英寸。At the same time, the size of the Robot cannot exceed 18✖️18✖️18 inches.\n3.2. 机器设计/Design the Robot：\n接下来，我们进行了机器人的具体设计，并进行了建模：Next, we carried out the specific design of the robot and started the modeling：（建模图片/Picture of the Model）\n底盘的部分我们采用了四驱H型底盘的设计，以保证机器能够稳定行驶。For the chassis, we adopt the design of 4WD H-type chassis to ensure the stable driving of the robot.\n套环装置则是主要由齿轮、履带，和长螺丝钉组成，配合电机可实现将圆环投掷到环塔的功能。The ring device is mainly composed of gears, crawlers and long screws. Combined with the motor, it can throw the ring to the mobile goal.\n这样一来，机器人即可具备比赛所需的功能。In this way, the robot can have the functions required for the game.\n3.3. 开始搭建/Constructing the Robot:\n底盘/Chassis：在底盘的搭建过程中，我们把齿轮与电机连接，用齿轮带动车轮转动，并用履带连接前轮和后轮的齿轮，以确保前后轮转速一致。在此基础上，配合四驱的设计可以使机器人在自动赛时更顺利的直线行驶。During the construction of the chassis, we connect the gear with the motor, drive the wheel to rotate with the gear, and connect the gears of the front and rear wheels to ensure the consistent speed of the front and rear wheels. On this basis, with the design of 4WD, the robot can travel more smoothly in a straight line during the automatic race.\n套环装置/Ring Device：套环装置主要由履带、齿轮，和几根较长的螺丝钉组成。这样的设计使得套环装置在连接了电机后能够顺时针或逆时针转动，并拾起或放下地上的圆环，以及将圆环套入环塔。The ring device is mainly composed of crawlers, gears, and several longer screws. This design enables the ring device to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise after the motor is connected, and also pick up or put down the ring on the ground, and sleeve the ring into the mobile goals.\n抬臂装置/Arm Lifting Device：在安装了套环装置后，我们开始着手搭建抬臂装置。抬臂装置主要分为两个部分：前抬臂装置和后抬臂装置。这两个部分分别安装在套环装置的前后，在功能上也略有不同。前抬臂装置可以举起环塔，并将环塔放到平衡桥上平衡；而后抬臂装置则仅可以小幅度抬起、倾斜环塔，以便于配合套环装置将圆环套入或放入环塔。After builidng the ring device, we started to build the arm lifting device. The arm lifting device is mainly divided into two parts: the front- and the rear arm lifting device. These two parts are respectively installed at the front and back of the ring device, and their functions are also different. The front arm lifting device can lift the mobile goal and place the ring tower on the platform for balance; while the rear arm lifting device can only lift and tilt the ring mobile goal in a small range, so as to cooperate with the ring device to nest or place the ring into the mobile goal.\n3.4. 搭建过程中遇到的问题/Problems encountered during the Construction:\n\n（问题图片/Picture of the Problem）在搭建底盘的过程中，我们原计划用链条连接前后轮的齿轮，于是我们为两边的前后轮分别安装了用来连接链条的小齿轮。但在组装的过程中我们发现可以直接连接前后轮的齿轮，因此我们不得不拆掉小齿轮再重新组装中型齿轮。In the process of constructing the chassis, we originally planned to connect the gears of the front and rear wheels with a chain, so we installed pinions for the front and rear wheels on both sides to connect the chain. However, during the assembly process, we found that the gears of the front and rear wheels can be directly connected, so we had to remove the pinion and reassemble the medium gear.\n\n（问题图片/Picture of the Problem）在连接前后轮齿轮的过程中，我们又遇到了新的问题：由于齿轮的数量是偶数，导致机器人前后轮的旋转方向不一致，从而使机器人无法向指定方向移动。为了解决这个问题，我们不得不将前后轮的齿轮错开来安装，再用小齿轮连接前后轮，以保持机器的车轮正常滚动。In the process of connecting the front and rear gears, we encounter a new problem: because the number of gears is even, the rotation direction of the front and rear wheels of the robot is inconsistent, so that the robot cannot move in the specified direction. In order to solve this problem, we have to stagger the gears of the front and rear wheels, and then connect the front and rear wheels with pinions to keep the wheels of the robot rolling normally.\n\n（问题图片/Picture of the problem）初步结束了底盘的组装后，我们又发现了一个问题：底盘电机安装过早，影响了机器的后续搭建。为了解决这个问题，我们不得不将底盘拆开、取出电机，以继续机器的后续搭建。After the preliminary assembly of the chassis, we found another problem: the chassis motor was installed too early, which affected the subsequent construction of the robot. In order to solve this problem, we have to disassemble the chassis and take out the motor to continue the subsequent construction of the robot.\n\n（问题图片/Picture of the Problem）在衔接套环装置与后抬臂装置时，我们发现我们的计算出现了错误，导致后抬臂装置在下降的时候会和套环装置的齿轮产生摩擦。而抬臂装置的位置由于尺寸原因不能更改，于是我们只能拆除套环装置并在更靠上的位置重新安装以和后抬臂装置错开。When connecting the ring device and the rear boom device, we found that our calculation was wrong, resulting in friction between the rear arm lifting device and the gear of the ring device when descending. The position of the arm lifting device cannot be changed due to size, so we can only remove the ring device and reinstall it at a higher position to stagger with the rear arm lifting device.\n\n（问题图片/Picture of the Problem）而在搭建前抬臂装置时，由于找不到合适的材料，导致我们搭建的前抬臂装置过短，无法与底盘相连接。于是我们不得不先拆掉它并补充合适的材料，再重新组装。When constructing the front arm lifting device, due to the shortage of materials, the front arm lifting device we built is too short to be connected with the chassis. So we had to dismantle it and add appropriate materials before reassembling.\n\n（问题图片/Picture of the Problem）在初步完成了套环装置和抬臂装置的搭建后，我们又遇到了新的问题：在后抬臂装置的齿轮的遮挡下，我们无法安装后抬臂装置的电机。因此我们不得不再次拆掉后抬臂装置以及与其相连的套环装置并在安装了抬臂装置的电机后再重新将他们装回原位。After the preliminary completion of the construction of the ring device and the arm lifting device, we encountered a new problem: under the intercept of the gear of the rear arm lifting device, we could not install the motor of the rear arm lifting device. Therefore, we had to remove the rear arm lifting device and the ring device connected to it again, and reinstall them after installing the motor of the rear arm lifting device.\n\n\n3.5. 机器改装/Modification of the Robot\n总结了以上问题后，我们决定对机器进行改装，搭建更完美、更适合比赛的第二代机器。After summarizing the problems above, we decided to build a second-generation robot that has a better function and is more suitable for competition.\n在第二代机器的设计过程中，我们的思路有所调整。我们删减了后抬臂装置的抬举功能，并添加了抓取环塔的功能。这一改动使得机器可以更牢固的抓住环塔，有效防止了环塔被对手抢走的情况，同时也有利于我方机器与对手争夺环塔。In the design process of the second-generation robot, we have deleted the lifting function of the rear arm lifting device and added the function of grabbing the ring tower. This change allows the robot to hold the ring tower more firmly, and can effectively preventing the ring tower from being snatched by the opponent, and it also helps our robot compete with the opponent for the ring tower.\n对前抬臂装置我们也做出了改动，我们摒弃了原先通过两根C形梁举起环塔的设计，而是改成了抓取的方式。这样一来即有便于机器掌控环塔，也提高了在自动和手动赛中从对手手中抢到环塔的概率。We also made changes to the front arm lifting device. We abandoned the original design of lifting the ring tower with two C-shaped channels and changed it to the way of grabbing. In this way, it is more convenient for the robot to control the tower, and it also increased the probability of grabbing the tower from the opponent in both automatic and manual competitions.\n这一代机器底盘的部分与上一代几乎是没有差别的，而套环装置则跟随抬臂装置做出了一定倾斜的调整。The chassis of this generation of robot is almost the same as the previous generation, but the collar device had made a certain tilt adjustment following the arm lifting device.\n当然，我们发现第二代机器也并没有解决所有问题，比如机器底盘的轮子还是很容易被地上的圆环卡住。因此我们又在此基础上为机器的底盘部分添加了透明挡板，有效降低了机器底盘被场地上的圆环卡住导致无法移动的概率。However, we found that the second-generation robot did not solve all the problems. For example, the wheels of chassis were still easily jammed by the rings on the ground. Therefore, we have added a transparent baffle to the chassis of the robot, which effectively reduced the probability that the chassis is stuck by the ring on the field and cannot move.\n4. 代码编写/Coding4.1. 第一代代码编写/First Generation Code\n在完成了机器的搭建后，我们开始根据机器的最终结构编写代码。首先我们编写了手动代码，手动代码共分为四个部分：\n\n底盘代码（移动功能）\n套环装置代码（套环功能）\n前抬臂装置代码（抬举环塔功能）\n后抬臂装置代码（搬运环塔功能）\n\nAfter completing the construction of the robot, we began to write code according to the final structure of the robot. First, we wrote the manual code, which is divided into four parts:\n\n Chassis\nRing device\nFront arm lifting device (lifting the ring tower)\nRear boom device (carrying the ring tower)\n\n有了上个赛季的经验，这次代码编写的过程相对更加顺利。但由于机器的结构和功能发生了变化，我们编写代码时还是遇到了一些困难：\n\n在编写底盘代码时，我们将机器的两个后轮的旋转方向设置反了，导致机器无法移动，于是我们及时做出了调整，将问题很快解决。\n由于机器功能的增多，我们在设置手柄按键时发现上个赛季对于手柄的设置不能满足本赛季的需求，因此我们针对本赛季机器的功能重新设置了手柄按键并解决了这个问题。\n连接了机器测试代码时，我们临时发现机器的许多电机都处于连接失败的状态，于是我们尝试重新连接并更换端口，但却都没有奏效。最终，在我们更换了连接失败的电机线后，所有电机终于恢复连接。但与此同时，由于电机端口发生了更改，我们不得不重新在VEXcode Pro V5重新配置电机端口。\n\nWith the experience of last season, the process of coding this time is relatively smoother. However, due to changes in the structure and functions of the robot, we still encountered some difficulties when writing code:\n\n When writing the chassis code, we reversed the rotation direction of the two rear wheels of the robot which caused the robot to be unable to move, so we made adjustments in time and solved the problem quickly.\nDue to the increase in robot functions, when we set up the handle buttons, we found that the handle settings last season could not meet the needs of this season. Therefore, we reset the handle buttons for the robot functions this season and solved this problem.\nWhen the test code of the robot was connected, we temporarily found that many motors of the robot were in a connection failure state, so we tried to reconnect and change the port, but it didn’t work. Finally, after we replaced the failed motor cables, all motors finally restored their connections. But at the same time, due to the change of the motor port, we had to reconfigure the motor port in VEXcode Pro V5.\n\n在对机器进行了一系列调试后，我们连接了代码进行测试。在测试过程中我们发现了两个问题：\n\n机器的后抬臂装置抬不起来，起初我们以为是后抬臂装置的边缘部分和机器的底盘卡住了，于是我们用锉刀打磨了后抬臂装置的边缘。然而问题仍未解决，后来我们才发现这个问题是由于底盘向内倾斜，导致后抬臂装置和底盘的连接部分卡住而产生的。\n机器在行驶过程中会歪斜，这是因为机器的轮子没有拧紧，且由于底盘的结构原因，机器的全部重量几乎都由底盘内侧的C形梁承担，导致机器的底盘向内侧向中心凹陷。\n\nAfter a series of debugging to the robot, we connected the code for testing. During the test, we found two problems:\n\nThe rear arm device of the robot cannot be lifted up. At first we thought that the edge of the rear arm device and the chassis of the robot were stuck, so we used a file to polish the edge of the rear arm device. However, the problem was still unresolved. Later we discovered that the problem was caused by the inward tilting of the chassis, which caused the connection between the rear arm device and the chassis to jam.\nThe robot will skew during driving. This is because the wheels of the robot are not tightened, and due to the structure of the chassis, almost all the weight of the robot  is borne by the C-shaped beam inside the chassis, which causes the chassis of the robot to sag inward to the center. \n\n4.2. 第二代代码编写/Second Generation Code\n为了解决测试代码过程中遇到的问题，我们结合第二代机器的结构编写了第二代代码。其实第二代手动代码相较于第一代在功能方面没有太大变化，只是电机的位置以及齿轮转动的方向和速度改变了，因此我们只需要重新设置电机的位置和旋转方向&amp;速度。In order to solve the problems encountered in the process of testing the code, we combined the structure of the second-generation robot to write the second-generation code. In fact, the second-generation driver controlled code has not changed much in terms of function compared to the first-generation, except that the position of the motor and the direction and speed of the gear rotation have changed, so we only need to reset the position and rotation direction &amp; speed of the motor.\n而自动赛代码的变化就要多一些了，机器抬臂装置功能的变化导致我们对自动赛策略做出了更改，因此我们需要对机器的行驶路线做出改变。The autonomous code will change a bit more. The change in the function of the robot’s arm lifting device has caused us to make changes to the automatic competition strategy, so we need to make changes to the robot’s driving route.\n同时，在测试自动代码的过程中，我们发现如果将机器的速度设置为100%，机器会因为惯性偏离指定的路线。因此我们需要在机器距离目的地还有一段距离时将电机的转速调小，使机器的速度下降并停在指定的目的地。At the same time, in the process of testing the automatic code, we found that if the speed of the robot is set to 100%, the robot will deviate from the specified route due to inertia. Therefore, we need to reduce the speed of the motor when the robot is still some distance away from the destination, so that the speed of the robot will drop and stop at the designated destination.\n（代码图片/Picture of the Code）\n5. 战术策划/Planning our Strategies由于本赛季的规则比起上个赛季要更加复杂，导致策略的规划尤为重要。首先，因为本赛季无需占领而是需要抢夺，这导致手动赛每一个环塔都有可能在任何地方，这对操作和指挥的临场发挥变的极其重要。Because this season’s rule is much harder than any season before because of this the strategy will be very different. First, because this season we don’t need to occupy instead we are snatching the tower. This will lead to the strategy of manual has a lot of unsure for example every Mobile Goal might be anywhere.\n5.1. 自动赛策略/Autonomous Strategy\n本赛季我们队所采用的策略是无论自动赛是在左边还是右边必须抢到2个中立塔这样才能保证我们队在手动赛的时候在塔的数量上有一定的优势。For this season the tactics we decide is to get at less 2 neutral mobile goal, because this will let our team has advantage in the numbers if goals our team has\n右边Right首先机器会去抢3号塔并将其拖回到我方联队区域，然后再去抢4号塔并拖回，最后往后移并移除awp线。First the robot will grab the third tower and come back to our alliance home zone, then grab the fourth tower and come back, at last the robot will go back and clear the AWP line.如果这个策略成功了，我们联队将会有4个塔以上其中包含2个联队环塔和两个中立环塔并且可以达成移除AWP线。If this tactic succeed our alliance will have 4 goal which include 2 alliance goal and two neutral goal and at the same time has the AWP line cleared.\n右边Left首先机器会将抢到5号塔并回到我方联队的区域然后前往4号塔并夺回。First the robot will go and grab the fifth mobile goal and come back then go and grab the fourth goal.当自动赛结束时我方这台机器将会带回来两个塔在加上原本的两个联队环塔基本上可以赢得自动赛并获得一个环塔数量上的领先。When the autonomous end this robot will bring two nurture mobile goal back and add the two alliance mobile goal this alliance will have a total of 4 mobile goals. This will lid to the winning of autonomous and has a advantage on the number of mobile goals.\n5.2. 手动赛策略/Driver Controlled Strategy\n在制定手动赛的的策略前，我们首先观看了大量其他队伍比赛的视频，并反复观察了他们的机器结构以及策略。在建立了对对手的了解后，我们开始结合自己的机器特点有针对性的制定计划。Before planning the strategy for the driver controlled period, we first watched a lot of videos of other teams’ competitions and repeatedly observed their robot‘s structure and strategies. After establishing an understanding of our opponents, we began to make targeted plans based on the characteristics of our robot.\n根据我们的观察，我们总结了几种有代表性的机器人的特点和策略，以及对抗它们的战术：\n\n“轻便型机器人”：这类机器人的结构非常简单，在采用了尽量少的材料维持基本功能的同时保证机器人足够轻便，可以使两台机器人同时在平衡桥上达成平衡。如果对面联队同时有两台这样的机器人，那他们的战术一定是每台机器尽快拿到两个同色或黄色环塔然后立即上平衡桥平衡。这样如果成功，他们的手动赛即可获得220分的总分，是完全无法击败的。因此对抗这类对手，我们的联队必须抢到四个黄色或对面颜色的环塔（最好是黄色），再使其中的黄色环塔和至少一台机器在平衡桥上平衡，才能保证手动赛获胜。\n“高抬臂型机器人”：这类机器的结构较为复杂，操作起来相对笨重，但有一个非常高的抬臂式套环装置，因此在套环方面非常有优势。通常这类机器会采用靠套环得分的策略，因为他们可以将圆环套到最高的10分环塔上，这是非常容易的得分的。但它们也有缺点，那就是在套环过程中机器重心不稳并且移动非常缓慢，这是抬臂装置过长过重导致的。针对这两个弊端，我们在比赛的过程中可以在它们套环的时候进行干扰，使他们重心偏移继而无法完成套环。同时，我们也可以尽可能的不让对方抢到最高的黄色环塔，从根本解决问题。\n\nBased on our observations, we have summarized the characteristics and strategies of several representative robots, as well as the tactics against them:\n\n“Simple-Structured Robot”: This type of robot has a very simple structure. It used as little material as possible to maintain basic functions while ensuring that the robot is light enough to balance the two robots on the platform at the same time. If the opponents has two such robots at the same time, then their tactic must be that each robot gets two of their own colored or yellow mobile goal as soon as possible and then immediately goes on the platform to balance. In this way, if they succeed, they can get a total of 220 points in the manual competition, which is completely unbeatable. Therefore, against such opponents, our alliance must grab four yellow or opposite colored mobile goals (preferably yellow), and then balance the yellow mobile goals and at least one robot on the platform to ensure the manual competition wins.\n“High-arm lifting device robot”: This type of robot has a more complicated structure and is relatively cumbersome to operate, but it has a very long-armed ring device, so it is very advantageous in terms of scoring rings. Usually such robots will use the strategy of scoring by the ring, because they can put the ring on the highest 10-point mobile goal, which is very easy to score. But they also have shortcomings, that is, the center of gravity of the robot is unstable and moves very slowly during the process of scoring rings, which is caused by the excessively long and heavy arm lifting device. In response to these two drawbacks, we can interfere their robots when they are scoring rings during the game, causing them to shift their center of gravity and failing to score the rings. At the same time, we can also prevent the opponent from grabbing the highest yellow mobile goal as much as possible to solve the problem fundamentally.\n\n5.3. 技能挑战赛策略/Skills Challenge Strategy\n技能挑战赛我们队的目标是至少要拿到250分以上因此我们的路线设计是让机器在对面放两个塔一个中立塔和一个联队塔。并且将另外一个联队环塔和一个中立塔在区域内。并在另外一边放入一个中立塔让后让机器前面和后面都夹上环塔上平衡桥。For the skills the target our team want to achieve is to get 250 at less, to do this the root our team has design is to put 1 alliance mobile goal and 1 neutral mobile goal on the opposite side platform and leaf an alliance mobile goal and a neutral mobile goal in the opposite alliance home zone. And for the other side there will be a neutral mobile goal in the home zone and the robot is going to carry two alliance mobile goals and get onto the platform to balance.\n","slug":"vex2","date":"2021-08-07T03:41:16.421Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"Alpha"}]
